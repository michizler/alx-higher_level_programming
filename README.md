# alx-higher_programming

This repository aims at showing and improving my skills in higher-level programming languages. The language it will be focusing on is the Python language. It'd go from basic syntax to control flow, from data structures to object-oriented programming to demonstrate the aforementioned. Happy coding to you and myself.

Cheers!
